# lamport-vector-clocks

An algorithm will help you to solve Lamport vector clocks examples.

## Installation

- Make sure you have python3 installed.
- No need to install any modules.

## How to use?

- Just run the program by the following command:

```shell
python3 main.py
```

- By default it the script initialize event at `(0,0,0)`, so the program will ask you about number of events in every process.
- Then you have to entered the number of messages, and who send it and who receive it.
- You have to sequential arrangement every event by letter as in the following example (until you can determine sender and receiver by its letter).

## Update

I released a new version from my program, so the new is working better, more efficient, and it support more than three processes.
